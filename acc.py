    Goal: to select the data relevant for the analysis. Since the most

    the pH analysis), this is the data that will be selected. And due to
    the rate that the pH increases over time for each pulse decreases 
    (one can say it decelarates??), two slope values will be used to
    select data. note: target_slope1 should ALWAYS be higher than 
    target_slope2;
    Input1: the ouput of declive function; 2D np.array with (m x 4) dimensions;
    Input2: the number of slopes that will be used to select data; it can only
    take the values of 1 or 2;
    Input3: the fraction of values of mat that will be selected based on
    target_slope1;
    Input4: the value of target_slope1;
    Input5: the value of target_slope2;
    Input6: when the slope is calculated, the first window values are all zeros;
    then slopes start being calculated after there's more than window values;
    because of this, the selection of values must taken into account this shift;
    otherwise, values would have a shift of window/2 points to right, which is
    a loss of relevant data;

    in the function selecting is not because it is not built correctly, but
